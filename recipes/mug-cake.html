        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Three ingredient mug cake recipe is a delicous indulgent mug cake in minutes</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup Nutella</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Flour</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a microwave-safe tall mug (at least 12 oz or 350 ml), start by cracking the egg into the mug. Add the Nutella and flour.</li>
            <li>Using a fork or small whisk, mix everything together until you have a smooth batter. Ensure that there are no lumps of flour remaining</li>
            <li>Place your mug in the microwave and cook on high for about 1 minute and 15 seconds to 1 minute and 30 seconds. The exact time may vary depending on your microwave's power, so keep an eye on it as it cooks.</li>
            <li>Once done, carefully remove the mug from the microwave (it will be hot). The cake should look set but still slightly moist on top â€“ that's when it's perfect.</li>
            <li>Serve with more Nutella on top, powdered sugar, whipped cream, or enjoy it by itself!</li>
            <li>Let it cool for a minute or two before digging in with a spoon directly from the mug or transferring it onto a plate if you prefer.</li>
        </ol>
