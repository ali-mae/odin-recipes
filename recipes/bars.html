    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Youâ€™ve probably heard of classic Millionaire Bars, but our Chocolate Chip Cookie Millionaire Bars take them to a whole new level. Instead of the traditional crisp shortbread base, we use a chewy, buttery chocolate chip cookie dough for a comforting, familiar texture (and a super easy shortcut!).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Baking spray with flour</li>
        <li>2 packages refrigerated break-and-bake chocolate chip cookie dough</li>
        <li>2 cans sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup light corn syrup</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon table salt</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1 tablespoon parts, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 bars semisweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Spray a 13x9-inch baking pan with baking spray; line bottom and sides with parchment paper, leaving a 1-2 inch overhang on long sides.</li>
        <li>Break apart dough squares along perforations and evenly scatter in bottom of the prepared pan. Let stand at room temperature until softened, 5-10 minutes. Using a sheet of plastic wrap placed directly on surface, press doigh into an even layer in the bottom of the pan. Remove and discard plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean when insterted in center, 25-30 minutes. Let cool in pan on a wire rack while making filling.</li>
        <li>Add condensed milk, brown sugar, corn syrup, salt, and 1 cup of the butter to a large saucepan; cook over medium, whisking constantly, until butter is melted and mixture starts to bubble, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook, whisking constantly, over medium until mixture is a caramel color, thickened, and about 235 degrees F, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla until combined.</li>
        <li>Working quickly, pour caramel over cookie layer, spreading into an even layer with a small offset spatula. Chill in refrigerator, uncovered, until set, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Add Chocolate, cream, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter to a medium, heatproof bowl; place bowl over a saucepan filled with 1 inch of simmering water, making sure bottom of bowl does not touch water. Cook, stirring constantly, until chocolate mixture is melted and smooth, 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Working quickly, pour, and spread chocolate mixture evenly over caramel layer, chill in refrigerator, uncovered, until set, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Using parchment paper as handles, remove from pan and place on a cutting board. Using a warm, dry, sharp knife, cut into bars. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container at room temperature for 3-5 days.</li>
    </ol>
